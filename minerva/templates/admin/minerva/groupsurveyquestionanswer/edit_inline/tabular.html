{% include "admin/edit_inline/tabular.html" %}

<!--
This import is here to ensure that the `document.ready` handler contained
within groups.js is executed after the `document.ready` handler in
`tabular.html`. This is because it is the `document.ready` handler in
`tabular.html` which creates the 'Add another Group Survey Question Answer'
button, which we need to attach a handler to too.
